**An AI-powered, 100% self-developed plant disease diagnosis system for farmers in Sarawak, with an initial focus on Black Pepper cultivation.**

This project is a complete end-to-end web application designed to provide instant, AI-driven diagnosis of crop diseases. It leverages a custom deep learning model trained from scratch, soft computing techniques for risk analysis, and a dynamic knowledge base to deliver accurate, localized, and easy-to-understand advice in multiple languages.

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **üì∏ AI Disease Diagnosis:** Upload a photo of a plant leaf and get an instant diagnosis. The model is **100% self-developed** using PyTorch and trained from scratch on a curated dataset, with **no pre-trained models** used.
-   **üå¶Ô∏è Automated Risk Analysis:** Automatically fetches local weather data (temperature & humidity) via GPS and uses a Fuzzy Inference System to provide a contextual disease risk score.
-   **üìñ Dynamic Knowledge Base:** All diagnostic reports and management suggestions are dynamically generated in real-time from a structured YAML knowledge base, ensuring easy updates and scalability.
-   **üåê Multi-language Support:** The user interface and final reports are fully internationalized, supporting **English, Bahasa Malaysia, and Chinese**.
-   **üöÄ Lightweight & Accessible:** A simple web frontend ensures the tool is accessible on any device with a browser, with no installation required for the end-user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Backend:** FastAPI, PyTorch, Scikit-fuzzy, Uvicorn
-   **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Fetch API, Geolocation API)
-   **Data Science:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pillow
-   **Version Control:** Git & **Git LFS** (for handling large dataset files)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project and its complete dataset running on your local machine.

### üìã Prerequisites

1.  **Git & Git LFS:** You must have both installed.
    -   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    -   [Download Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
2.  **Python:** Version 3.10 is recommended. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3.  **(Optional for Training)** An NVIDIA GPU with updated CUDA drivers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Windows PowerShell)

*Run these commands in **Windows PowerShell as an Administrator**.*

**Step 1: Install Essential Tools via Chocolatey**
*   (If not already installed) Install the package manager:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```
*   **Close and reopen PowerShell as Administrator.**
*   Install Git, Git LFS, and Python:
    ```powershell
    choco install git git-lfs python --version=3.10 -y
    ```
*   **Close and reopen PowerShell as Administrator** again.

**Step 2: Enable Git LFS (One-Time Setup)**
```powershell
git lfs install

**Step 3: Clone the Main Project Repository**
This command will clone the project's source code.
code
Powershell
cd ~\Documents
git clone https://github.com/Siew22/Sarawak-Agriculture.git
cd Sarawak-Agriculture

Step 4: Download the Required Datasets
The project relies on external datasets. We will clone the PlantVillage-Dataset now. The other datasets (Mydataset) are already included in this repository via Git LFS.
code
Powershell
# This command downloads the large PlantVillage dataset
git clone https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset.git
Note: This is a very large repository and may take a significant amount of time to download.

Step 5: Set Up Python Environment
code
Powershell
# Allow script execution for this session
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
(You should now see (venv) at the beginning of your prompt.)

Step 6: Install Python Dependencies
code
Powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
‚úÖ Setup Complete! Your environment, including all code and required datasets, is now fully configured.

## üî¨ Training the Model

The repository includes all the necessary data to train the model from scratch.

-   Run the appropriate training script from the **project root directory**:
    ```powershell
    # For 12GB+ VRAM (Recommended)
    python train/train_model_2.py

    # For 6GB VRAM
    python train/train_model.py
    ```
-   After training, update the `MODEL_PATH` in `app/models/disease_classifier.py` to point to your new model file.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

### 1. Run the Backend Server

-   From the **project root directory** with your virtual environment active:
    ```powershell
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
-   The backend is now live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Run the Frontend

-   Navigate to the `frontend/` directory in your file explorer.
-   **Simply double-click the `index.html`** file to open it in your browser.
